# DERO Hive → AI Work Hub: Gap Analysis & Phased Roadmap

Date: 2026-07-17 · Basis: full-source audit of `src/main`, `src/shared`, `src/renderer`, `cli/`, `resources/` (8 parallel audit passes, all claims verified against code).

---

## 0. Executive Summary

The audit's headline: **this is much further along than "a desktop app that talks to LLMs"** — provider abstraction with fallback chains, MCP client, permission system, skills lifecycle, swarm prototype, knowledge vault, voice, and a CLI that reuses the desktop's services all exist and mostly work. The mission is therefore extension, exactly as requested.

But the audit also found **claimed-but-dead or cosmetic features** that must be fixed before building on top of them, because several target features (cost routing, autonomy, evals) depend on them:

- **Cost tracking is a facade.** `ProviderModel.inputPrice/outputPrice` are read by both dashboards but *no code path ever writes them* — every cost figure renders "—". OpenRouter's `pricing` field is fetched but not parsed.
- **Swarm persistence is vaporware.** `swarm_runs`/`swarm_tasks` tables exist (migration v9, with `phase`/`worktree_path` columns) but nothing reads or writes them; swarm execution lives entirely in the renderer, run records are in-memory, and worker conversations are deleted after each run.
- **Desktop plan mode is advisory-only with API providers** — it injects a system-prompt note but does not filter tools (real filtering exists only in the CLI and for Codex ACP).
- **`cli/src/utils/agentMemory.ts` (290 lines, a real ranked-memory library) is dead code** — nothing outside its tests imports it.
- **No checkpoint/rollback for file edits.** Before/after snapshots are 50 KB-capped, held in renderer memory, display-only, and die on conversation switch. Git is the only revert path.
- **Historical tool-call results never re-render** after conversation reload (results live in an in-memory map fed only by live stream events).
- **`run_shell` is unsandboxed** — full user environment, unrestricted network, unrestricted command string; only `cwd` is path-validated.
- **Agent reads of secrets are unguarded** — `read_file` will happily ship a workspace `.env` to the LLM.
- **Approval coverage has holes** — `generate_image/audio/video` (spend money), `generate_tela_dapp`, `simulator_create_wallet` never prompt; trusted MCP servers skip all prompts.
- **Errors are untyped strings** ending in a dismiss-only banner; the transparent auto-retry/fallback is never surfaced.
- **Config lives in one SQLite DB** — no export/import of providers/agents/permissions/settings; the `mcp.json` path is defined but unused.

## 1. Gap Analysis by Feature Area

Effort: **S** < 1 day · **M** 1–3 days · **L** multi-day / architectural. Risk: low / med / high (blast radius if done wrong).

### 1. Provider & Model Layer

Where we are: unified schema in `src/shared/types.ts` + `presets.ts` (12 presets incl. **OpenCode Zen and Go — already done**); 3 adapters (`openai-compatible`, `anthropic`, `codex-acp`); live capability fetch (OpenRouter/Ollama/Anthropic) + static table (~80 models); fallback chains with full conversation-state preservation (pre-output only, `chat.ts:122-156`).

| Gap | Effort | Risk | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bedrock / Vertex / Azure presets | M (Azure S–M) | med | Azure ≈ OpenAI-compat + `api-version` + deployment routing. Bedrock needs SigV4 signing, Vertex needs GCP OAuth — new auth paths in main only |
| llama.cpp server / LM Studio presets | S | low | Already reachable via `custom`; make named presets with correct defaults |
| Prompt-caching capability flag + Anthropic `cache_control` + cached-token usage capture | M | low | `anthropic.ts` claims caching in a comment but never sends `cache_control`; cached tokens not captured anywhere |
| Pricing data pipeline (parse OpenRouter `pricing`, static table, editor) | S | low | Unblocks cost dashboard AND cost routing |
| Failover error classification (429 vs 5xx vs auth) | M | low | Today "any error = next provider", no retry-after handling |
| Per-role model config (chat / background / utility / cheap) | M | med | Prerequisite for routing + cheap-model offload |
| Cost-aware router w/ escalation signals (context length, repeated failures, user override) | M | med | Deterministic policy-as-data executed in `chat.ts` pre-request; depends on pricing + classification |
| Ollama first-class: `/api/show` real context, pull, `num_ctx`, keep-alive | M | low | Currently just an OpenAI-compat endpoint |
| VRAM fit check + KV-cache quant surfacing | M | low | Estimate from model size metadata + user GPU profile setting; encode RTX 5080/5070 Ti knowledge as presets |

### 2. Agent Orchestration

Where we are: Swarm exists (parallel specialists → one-shot Verify → Synthesizer) but is a 360-line renderer component with hardcoded topology; 17 prompt-only personas; dispatch heuristic for auto-swarm.

| Gap | Effort | Risk | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AgentDefinition` v2: model override, tool allow-list, skill refs, context budget | M | med | Schema + migration + resolution logic; unlocks templates, roster, sub-agents |
| Enforced per-agent tool scoping (today "read-only worker" is prompt text) | S–M | low | Filter in `ToolRegistry.listTools`/dispatch once agents carry allow-lists |
| Sub-agent spawn tool (planner → worker, isolated context + budget, report-back) | M | med | New built-in `spawn_agent` tool; execution in main process |
| Critique/refine loop primitive (generator → critic → refine until pass/budget) | M | low | Generalize Verify into a reusable pattern runner |
| General graph execution engine (nodes/edges/hand-offs as data, main-process) | L | high | The big one; supersedes renderer SwarmModal; persists runs |
| Live orchestration view (which agent active + why) | M | med | Depends on engine events + multi-session renderer (5.) |
| Self-evolve in-app: start/pause/kill, backlog view, run history, cycle diffs | L | high | Driver in main process; depends on checkpoints (3.), run history (6.), trust (7.); honor existing STOP/PAUSE sentinels |

### 3. Tooling & MCP

Where we are: 21 built-ins (read/write/edit/glob/grep/shell/todo/DERO/media); MCP stdio + streamable-HTTP with tool/resource/prompt **discovery**; 4-mode approval with persisted per-tool rules (substring/regex patterns); symlink-safe path containment.

| Gap | Effort | Risk | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Web fetch + web search tools | S–M | low | Biggest parity hole vs OpenCode; search needs a provider (Brave/Tavily key or local SearXNG) |
| Structured git tools (status/diff/log/commit; push always-confirm) | S–M | med | Stops funneling git through opaque `run_shell`; distinguishes commit vs push |
| OS-level sandboxing for `run_shell` | L | high | See ADL-2; staged approach, Phase 1 delivers audit+trust baseline |
| Fix approval bypasses (media gen, tela scaffold, simulator wallet) | S | low | One list in `registry.ts:172-182` + trusted-MCP write gating |
| Desktop permission-rules manager UI (rules are CLI-only today) | M | low | Panel + IPC over existing `permissions` table |
| True glob + per-directory path rules | M | med | Current `pattern` is substring/regex on stringified args; needs path semantics |
| Per-agent MCP tool allow-lists | S–M | low | Follows AgentDefinition v2 |
| MCP namespacing (`server:tool` advertised names) | M | med | Breaking for saved rules; collisions currently first-match-wins, builtins shadow MCP |
| MCP resources/prompts consumption (`readResource`/`getPrompt` don't exist) | M | low | Discovery exists; wire into context/composer |
| Tool-call re-run + edit-args-and-retry in transcript | M | low | Also fix historical-result rendering bug |
| `edit_file` multi-hunk / patch-style edits | M | med | Current: single exact-match replacement per call |

### 4. Context & Memory

Where we are: auto+manual compaction at 85% (regex-heuristic, not LLM); knowledge vault (Obsidian via MCP, consent-gated, digests) but **never injected into chat context**; full skills lifecycle (discovery/parse/sync/import UI) but global enable, prompt-replacement injection, no watcher.

| Gap | Effort | Risk | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| First-class project memory store (persistent facts/decisions, hand-editable) | M | med | Revive `agentMemory.ts` ranking; file-backed (`.hive/memory.md` in project) + db index — syncs via folder sync, editable anywhere (ADL-5) |
| Session memory vs project memory UI (view/edit both) | M | low | Memory panel + composer indicator |
| Memory injection into context with per-component token budgets | M | med | `tokenBudget.ts` is estimation-only today; no per-component caps exist |
| LLM-summarizing compaction (replace regex heuristics) + compaction archive/log viewer | M | med | Originals are hard-deleted today; archive dropped messages + "what got compacted" view |
| Semantic search (embeddings + local vector store over sessions + project files) | L | med | See ADL-1; biggest single infra add in this area |
| Per-session skill toggles + browse panel | S–M | low | `skills.enabled` is global; add per-conversation map |
| Skills: import-by-reference, fs watcher, external "home" folder, companion dirs | M | low | Copy-only + restart/rescan today; fixes Homebase sync use-case |
| Skills stop replacing the whole system prompt on invoke | S | low | Compose instead of replace (`chat.ts:320`) |

### 5. Sessions & Projects

Where we are: fork (whole + from-message) with `parent_id`; per-conversation model/provider/system-prompt; **main process already runs N concurrent streams** (`activeRequests` map); renderer is architecturally single-session (events for non-visible conversations are dropped).

| Gap | Effort | Risk | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Multi-session renderer: per-conversation stream state, tabs, background progress, permission-prompt attribution | L | med | Store restructure (`stores/app.ts` single streaming buffer → per-conv map); unlocks orchestration UX + concurrent work |
| Checkpoint/rollback for agent file edits (persisted, revertible) | M | med | See ADL-3; foundation for per-hunk review AND self-evolve diffs |
| Fork branch tree + navigation (siblings, fork point, view-parent click-through) | S–M | low | `parent_id` exists; store fork-point message id |
| Project templates (skills/agents/permissions/model presets; "DERO dev", "BA") | M | low | Extend `projects.config`; depends on AgentDefinition v2 |
| Per-session agent + permission config (currently global settings) | M | med | Part of multi-session work |

### 6. Observability & Cost

Where we are: per-message token usage recorded; UsagePanel today/7d/30d by model+provider (but cost dead); budget alerts; per-turn token bar; leveled file logger.

| Gap | Effort | Risk | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Populate pricing (see 1.) — makes the existing dashboard real | S | low | Highest leverage-per-hour in the whole list |
| Live per-session token/cost meter (stream `usage` events; currently dropped at `useChat.ts:55`) | S | low | |
| Cached-token capture (Anthropic + OpenAI) | S | low | |
| Error taxonomy: provider vs tool vs harness, with retry/abort + visible fallback notices | M | low | Typed errors through `StreamEvent`; persist `messages.error` (dead column) |
| Full request/response payload logging (toggleable, redacted) | M | med | Redaction must be provable; off by default |
| Run history (activate `swarm_runs`/`swarm_tasks`; duration, tokens/cost, pass/fail, diff summary) | M | low | Schema exists; write from main-process runner |
| Tool-execution audit trail (persisted: args-redacted, decision, files touched) | M | med | Feeds sandbox story + security requirement |

### 7. Security & Secrets

Where we are: secrets in Electron safeStorage (v2) with documented v1 obfuscation fallback; renderer never sees keys; no plaintext keys on disk (verified); loopback-only bridges; hashed pairing tokens.

| Gap | Effort | Risk | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Secret-file guard for agent tools (`.env*`, `*.pem`, `id_rsa`, `*.key` denied by default) | S | low | Currently `read_file` ships `.env` to the LLM |
| Log redaction utility (Bearer/sk-/AKIA patterns) applied at all call sites | S | med | `HIVE_DEBUG` SSE fragments are logged unredacted today |
| Per-project trust level gating auto-run modes (untrusted ⇒ always ask) | M | low | `never`/autopilot is offered globally today |
| Harden `SHELL_RUN` IPC (arbitrary exec, only cwd validated) | M | med | Gate behind trust + approval like `run_shell` |
| OS sandbox for tool execution (FS scope + network egress control + touched-files audit) | M–L | high | ADL-2 **(revised)**; a restricted-token + ACL runner governs FS on Windows with no container. Network egress is a separate, still-unsolved mechanism |
| Scope FS allowed-roots to *active* project only | S | med | Today every registered project widens renderer FS reach globally |

### 8. Extensibility

Where we are: MCP = only true plugin mechanism; custom OpenAI-compatible providers via UI; skills/slash-commands/agents/custom-CSS are file-based; new provider = edit ≥5 files + rebuild.

| Gap | Effort | Risk | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Config-as-code export/import (providers sans keys, agents, permissions, projects, settings, skill refs) | M | med | ADL-4; solves the two-machine problem; secrets excluded by design, re-prompted on import |
| Plugin API (manifest, tools/providers/panels without forking) | L | high | ADL-6; recommend MCP-plus-thin-registry, not a sandboxed JS runtime |
| Skill import by reference + watcher (see 4.) | M | low | |

### 9. Multi-modal & Input

Where we are: image input end-to-end with vision gating + fallback filtering; audio on OpenAI path; whisper.cpp bundled dictation (~85%: 3 modes, device select); media generation studio.

| Gap | Effort | Risk | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Paste-to-attach (clipboard images/files/text → attachment) | S | low | No `onPaste` handler exists anywhere in renderer |
| Push-to-talk + VAD auto-stop + true streaming whisper | M | low | Current "live" mode re-transcribes the whole buffer every 1.4 s |

### 10. Developer Experience / UI

Where we are: Activity panel (view-only diffs); Code tab (explorer + hljs editor + one piped shell + embedded chat); Ctrl+K palette (navigation/conversations/skill-insert); theme engine (4 presets + accent + custom CSS); ErrorBoundary.

| Gap | Effort | Risk | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Per-hunk accept/reject diff review | M | med | Builds on checkpoints (ADL-3); Activity panel is view-only today; permission dialog shows raw JSON not a diff |
| Permission dialog renders a diff for file writes | S | low | Snapshot meta already exists at decision time |
| Palette: model/agent/theme switching (CLI Ctrl+P parity) | S | low | |
| PTY terminal (node-pty, tabs/splits, interactive programs) | M | med | Current: one sentinel-framed piped shell, no PTY; native rebuild for Electron |
| Neon/cyan-magenta theme preset | S (≈15 lines, 2 files) | low | `theme.ts:60` + `GeneralPanel.tsx:166` |

### 11. Testing & Evaluation

Where we are: 45 tsx assert-script tests (all passing), typecheck ×3, eslint; `vitest.config.ts` is an intentional empty stub; **no CI at all**.

| Gap | Effort | Risk | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Eval harness: replayable sessions + outcome assertions against mocked providers | L | med | ADL-7; golden fixtures + nock-style provider mocks + live mode |
| stop-slop quality gate as built-in output check | M | low | No trace in repo today; surface its checks as a post-generation gate (needs the skill's check list encoded) |
| CI (GitHub Actions: typecheck + lint + tests) | S | low | Tests already scriptable |

---

## 2. Phased Roadmap

Ordered by leverage: each phase unlocks the next. Every phase ships useful value alone.

**Phase 0 — Correctness quick wins** (days, zero dependencies, mostly bug fixes)
Fix historical tool-result rendering; permission dialog shows diffs; approval-bypass fixes; secret-file guard; log redaction; skill-invoke prompt composition (not replacement); palette model/agent switching; paste-to-attach; neon theme; CI workflow. *Why first: cheap trust + several README claims become true.*

**Phase 1 — Trust & Cost Foundation** (fully scoped in §4)
Pricing pipeline + live meter + cached tokens; error taxonomy + visible fallback/retry; per-project trust levels; tool-execution audit log; **file-edit checkpoints + rollback**; desktop permission-rules UI + real desktop plan mode.
*Why this is the keystone: cost routing needs pricing data; self-evolve needs checkpoints + trust + audit; per-hunk review needs checkpoints; eval harness needs typed errors. Everything autonomous later stands on this.*

**Phase 2 — Provider Parity & Routing**
Azure preset; Bedrock (SigV4); Vertex (OAuth); llama.cpp/LM Studio presets; prompt-caching flag + Anthropic `cache_control` + cached-token billing; Ollama first-class (show/pull/num_ctx/keep-alive + VRAM/KV surfacing); failover classification (429/5xx/auth); per-role models; cost-aware router with escalation. **Config-as-code export/import** (independent track; schema now stable enough).

**Phase 3 — Agent Platform**
AgentDefinition v2 + enforced tool scoping; per-agent MCP allow-lists; sub-agent spawn tool; critique/refine primitive; main-process graph engine superseding SwarmModal (activating `swarm_runs`); live agent-status view; **multi-session renderer** (prereq, schedule first in-phase); web fetch/search + git tools + MCP namespacing; project templates (DERO-dev, BA).

**Phase 4 — Memory & Knowledge**
Project memory store (file-backed + ranked injection + budgets); memory UI; LLM compaction + archive/viewer; per-session skills + reference-import + watcher; semantic search (embeddings + vector store); opt-in vault→context injection.

**Phase 5 — Autonomy & Quality Gates**
Self-evolve loop in-app (driver, controls, backlog, run history, cycle diffs via checkpoints); OS sandbox (container-based, opt-in per project — ADL-2); eval harness; stop-slop gate; PTY terminal.

**Phase 6 — Platform Extensibility**
Plugin API (ADL-6); per-hunk accept/reject UI polish; voice polish (PTT/VAD/streaming); MCP resources/prompts consumption.

Explicitly NOT in any phase (guardrails honored): no second config format (all config extends `src/shared/types.ts`); MiMo/DeepSeek free pair remains a fully functional default everywhere (router defaults to free pair; semantic search defaults to local embeddings); no premium provider required for any baseline feature.

---

## 3. Architecture Decisions Log — for Oracle review before implementation

**ADL-1 · Vector store for semantic search (Phase 4).** Options: (a) `sqlite-vec` extension in the existing better-sqlite3 DB; (b) `hnswlib-node`; (c) pure-JS index (voy-search) in a sidecar file. **Recommend (a)**: one DB file, WAL, no new service, matches existing native-module build pipeline (sqlite-vec ships prebuilds loadable via better-sqlite3 `loadExtension`). Embeddings: local-first via Ollama `nomic-embed-text` or transformers.js MiniLM — keeps free default intact; provider embeddings (OpenAI voyage etc.) as opt-in. *Review point: extension loading under asar + CLI dual-build (`patch-sqlite3-dual.mjs`).*

**ADL-2 · Sandbox approach for `run_shell` (Phase 5; baseline in Phase 1).** ~~Windows truth: Job Objects restrict processes/resources but not filesystem paths or network. Options: (a) approval + audit only (status quo+); (b) per-project WSL2/Docker container execution with mounted workspace and `--network none` unless allowed; (c) Windows Sandbox (heavy, Pro-only); (d) restricted-token child processes (partial). **Recommend staged: Phase 1 ships (a) done properly (trust levels + audit trail); Phase 5 adds (b) as opt-in per project trust=standard+**, which is the only option that delivers the stated "scoped FS + no network unless allowed" with real enforcement.~~

> **Revised 2026-08-15 — the "container is the only realistic path" conclusion was wrong.** DeepSeek Harness ships `dsh-sandbox-windows-acl`, a working **restricted-token + ACL** runner that governs file effects with no container, no WSL2 and no Docker (option (d), which this entry dismissed as merely "partial"). Its design answers the objections that led to (b):
>
> - Modes are `read-only` / `workspace-write` / `danger-full-access`; the last never calls the sandbox at all.
> - **Enforcement is a reported fact, not a promise** — `full` or `partial`. Windows reports `partial` honestly, because the restricted token must retain `Everyone` for process initialisation (so external objects granting `Everyone` write stay writable) and NTFS hard links alias one file object across paths. Consumers requiring the absolute promise can reject on that signal.
> - A deterministic per-workspace write SID and standing ACE, plus a **random private temp directory with its own SID and revocable ACE per session/workspace pair** — sessions sharing a workspace share its write authority without inheriting each other's temp authority.
> - A fresh provider always picks a new temp path and SID, so crash residue can neither block nor authorise a resumed session.
> - A workspace equal to or containing the platform temp root **fails before any ACL mutation**, because its inheritable ACE would otherwise reach every private temp child.
> - Unusable runners **fail closed** with `SANDBOX_UNAVAILABLE`; execution never silently falls through unconfined.
>
> **Revised recommendation: (d) done properly, opt-in per project, Phase 4-ish rather than Phase 5** — it drops the desktop-app Docker/WSL2 dependency entirely. Network egress control is still out of scope for this mechanism (dsh explicitly excludes network and process visibility from its sandbox vocabulary), so "no network unless allowed" remains unsolved and would need a separate mechanism. Container execution stays available as a sibling capability-seam implementation for anyone who wants it, not as the baseline. Tracked as item 4.1 in [REMAINING_WORK.md](REMAINING_WORK.md).

*Review point: Docker/WSL2 dependency for a desktop app; fallback when absent = approval mode.*

**ADL-3 · Checkpoint storage (Phase 1).** Options: (a) shadow git repo per project (aider-style); (b) content-addressed snapshot store in userData + db index; (c) in-project `.hive/checkpoints/`. **Recommend (b)**: no repo pollution, works for non-git projects, dedupes by hash; snapshots keyed by tool_call_id so Activity entries, per-hunk review, and self-evolve diffs all read the same store. Full before-content captured (no 50 KB cap for persistence; cap display only). *Review point: storage growth — prune policy tied to conversation deletion.*

**ADL-4 · Config-as-code format (Phase 2).** **Recommend JSON documents validated by zod schemas generated alongside `src/shared/types.ts` types** (no second config format — the unified provider schema *is* the file format), one `hive-home/` folder: `providers.json` (keys as `secret://` refs), `agents.json`, `permissions.json`, `projects.json`, `settings.json`, `skills/` (by reference). Import reconciles by id, re-prompts for secrets. *Review point: YAML is friendlier to hand-edit but adds a parser dep and drift risk.*

**ADL-5 · Memory storage (Phase 4).** **Recommend file-backed project memory (`.hive/memory.md` in project, human-editable, syncs with folder/Homebase) mirrored into a db table for ranked retrieval** (revive `agentMemory.ts` scoring: Jaccard + recency + pin + budget). Session memory stays in conversation rows. *Review point: two writers (app + hand edits) — last-write-wins with mtime check.*

**ADL-6 · Plugin API shape (Phase 6).** Options: (a) sandboxed JS runtime (isolated-vm); (b) MCP-everything (plugins are local MCP servers); (c) in-process trusted modules with manifest. **Recommend (b)+(thin c): tools/providers ship as MCP servers or config entries (already works); add a narrow declarative "panel plugin" registry (manifest + webview) later.** A full sandboxed runtime is a large attack surface for marginal gain. *Review point: DERO Command Center (Engram/Netrunner/TELA) fits as bundled MCP + panel preset rather than a plugin-runtime tenant.*

**ADL-7 · Eval harness design (Phase 5).** **Recommend golden-session JSON fixtures (recorded via Phase 1 payload logging, sanitized) replayed against provider mocks**, assertions as data: `contains`, `not_contains`, `tool_called(name, args-match)`, `file_exists/content_match`, `max_turns`, `cost_ceiling`. Live-provider mode for smoke evals. *Review point: assertion brittleness vs deterministic mocks.*

**ADL-8 · Orchestration execution location (Phase 3).** **Recommend main-process graph engine** (nodes = agent+model+tool-scope+budget; edges = hand-off rules; state = scratchpad table), renderer subscribes to run events; CLI reuses the same engine (mirrors existing CLI/desktop service sharing). Renderer-side SwarmModal is retired to "launch config UI". *Rationale: persistence, reload survival, CLI parity, self-evolve reuse.*

**ADL-9 · Self-evolve driver (Phase 5).** **Recommend main-process loop runner**: file-based state in `SELF_EVOLVE/` (existing convention), honors `STOP`/`PAUSE` sentinels (already in `.gitignore`), each cycle = one graph-engine run with checkpoint diff captured, rows in `agent_runs`. Start/pause/kill = IPC to the runner. *Review point: cycle cost ceilings + mandatory trust=trusted project.*

**ADL-10 · Router design (Phase 2).** **Recommend deterministic policy-as-data**: roles (`chat`, `background`, `utility`) → ordered candidate list with cost ceilings; escalation triggers (context > X% of window, N consecutive tool failures, explicit user override) bump to next tier; every routing decision logged to the audit trail. No LLM-in-the-loop routing initially. *Rationale: predictable bills, debuggable, eval-able.*

---

## 4. Phase 1 Work Order — "Trust & Cost Foundation" (ready for Sisyphus)

Goal: make Hive safe to automate and honest about cost. No new user-facing "features" beyond visibility — this phase turns existing claims real.

### 1A. Pricing pipeline & live meter
- `src/main/providers/models.ts`: parse OpenRouter `pricing.prompt/completion` → `$/1M` into `ProviderModel.inputPrice/outputPrice`; Anthropic + OpenAI static prices into `KNOWN_MODELS` (`src/shared/modelMetadata.ts`); Groq/MiniMax/Kimi where published.
- `src/main/providers/anthropic.ts` + `openai-compatible.ts`: capture `cache_read_input_tokens`/`cache_creation_input_tokens` (and OpenAI `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`) into the usage object; extend usage type in `src/shared/types.ts`.
- `src/renderer/src/hooks/useChat.ts:55`: stop dropping `usage` events; accumulate live per-conversation in `stores/app.ts`; `TokenUsage.tsx` reads live accumulator; `UsagePanel.tsx` refreshes on `done`.

### 1B. Error taxonomy & visible resilience
- New `src/shared/errors.ts`: `HiveError { category: 'provider'|'tool'|'harness', kind: 'rate_limit'|'auth'|'quota'|'overloaded'|'network'|'invalid_request'|'unknown', retriable, retryAfterMs?, providerId?, model? }` with classifiers per adapter (status + body sniffing).
- `src/main/ipc/chat.ts`: use classification in `streamWithFallback` (rate_limit/overloaded ⇒ backoff then next target; auth/quota ⇒ abort chain); emit `fallback` stream event (from→to, reason); persist `messages.error`.
- `src/shared/types.ts`: `StreamEvent.error` becomes structured; `ChatView.tsx` banner gains category, Retry (resend last turn), Dismiss; fallback toast.

### 1C. Per-project trust levels
- `src/shared/types.ts`: `ProjectConfig.trust: 'untrusted'|'standard'|'trusted'` (default `standard`; migration in `db/client.ts` v14).
- `src/main/tools/registry.ts`: permission request path consults active project's trust — `untrusted` forces ask (ignores `never` mode and session/project grants; autopilot not offered in UI); `trusted` unlocks autopilot offering.
- UI: trust selector in `ProjectsPanel.tsx`; composer mode switcher (`ComposerToolbar.tsx`) filters disallowed modes.

### 1D. Tool-execution audit log
- Migration v15: `tool_executions(id, conversation_id, tool, args_redacted, decision, duration_ms, status, files_touched, created_at)`.
- `src/main/tools/registry.ts` + `src/main/ipc/shell.ts`: write rows (args passed through redaction util); new right-sidebar **Audit** tab (paged list, expandable).
- New `src/main/utils/redact.ts`: Bearer/sk-/AKIA/private-key patterns; applied to audit rows, logs, and (Phase-2) payload logging.

### 1E. File-edit checkpoints + rollback (ADL-3)
- New `src/main/checkpoints/store.ts`: content-addressed blobs under `userData/checkpoints/`; migration v16: `file_checkpoints(id, conversation_id, tool_call_id, path, before_hash, after_hash, size_bytes, created_at, reverted_at)`.
- `src/main/tools/builtin.ts`: `write_file`/`edit_file` capture full before-content (null for new files) pre-mutation; return `checkpointId` in meta.
- IPC `CHECKPOINT_REVERT` / `CHECKPOINT_LIST` / `CHECKPOINT_REVERT_ALL(conversationId, since)`; `ActivityPanel.tsx`: per-entry Revert + "revert conversation's changes" batch; snapshots survive conversation switch/restart (main-owned, not renderer memory).

### 1F. Desktop permission-rules UI + real plan mode
- Replace read-only `ToolsPanel.tsx` with rules manager (list/add/remove: tool, action, pattern, scope, project) over existing IPC/`permissions` table (parity with CLI `/permissions`).
- `src/main/ipc/chat.ts`: enforce plan mode tool filtering (port `PLAN_SAFE_TOOL_NAMES` approach from `cli/src/services/chat.ts:18-25`), not just a prompt note.

### Test plan (repo convention: tsx assert scripts, registered in `package.json`)
- `models.pricing.test.ts` — OpenRouter pricing parse fixtures; static table sanity.
- `errors.classify.test.ts` — status/body fixtures per adapter → correct kind/retriable.
- `redact.test.ts` — secret-pattern corpus (keys, .env blocks, PEM headers).
- `registry.trust.test.ts` — trust×mode matrix (untrusted+never ⇒ ask; deny rules absolute).
- `checkpoints.test.ts` — write/edit → capture → revert round-trips in temp dirs; new-file revert deletes; batch revert; 50KB+ file not truncated.
- `audit.log.test.ts` — execution writes row; args redacted; decision recorded.
- `useChat.usage.test.ts` — usage event accumulation reducer.
- Contract tests (style of `conversations.contract.test.ts`) for new IPC channels.
- Gate: `npm run typecheck && npm run test:all` green; manual checklist — forced-429 mock shows fallback toast + retry; `.env` read denied; cost figures populate for OpenRouter; revert restores file bytes exactly.

### Out of scope for Phase 1
New providers, routing policy, graph orchestration, sandbox containers, payload logging UI, per-hunk accept/reject (checkpoints land the data layer only), the `.env` secret-file guard (Phase 0 — the checklist line above predates the split).

### Status: DELIVERED 2026-07-17
All six workstreams implemented and verified: `npm run typecheck` (node+web+cli), `npm run test:all` (vision + shared + cli + lint ×2), `npm run test:renderer` — all green, including 8 new test files (errors, redact, pricing, cached-tokens, checkpoints, trust-matrix, plan-mode/fallback, usage accumulator). Known follow-ups: provider-native `requestPermission` (Codex ACP) not yet trust-gated; live cost chip may mis-price after a mid-turn fallback (persisted per-turn usage is correctly attributed); checkpoint revert intentionally overwrites later user edits (UI warns); CLI tool ctx lacks `toolCallId` wiring; `PermissionRule.createdAt` not surfaced in UI.
